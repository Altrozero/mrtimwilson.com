Hello All, This website is nothing more than a space for me to post personal creative projects that I've worked on.

More than anything, it's a personl motiviation tool to spur me on to make more interesting and more ambitious things going forward.

I'm trying not to post my professional work here, if you've landed at this website looking for me professionally, you can find me at [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothy-wilson-2ba58b48/). Professional I strated out as a fullstack developer, now I work for a game development studio in a variety of roles. 

Nothing on the site is here as a tutorial or a guide, but if you find something interesting and want to know more, feel free to get in touch.
