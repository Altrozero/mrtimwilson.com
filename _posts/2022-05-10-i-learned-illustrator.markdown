I've been wanted to get a bit more in to digital art for a while, I'm fairly familiar with photoshop and vector art seemed like the next best step. I initally tried something a bit more complicated than I originally intened trying to touch on as many different concepts of the software as I could.

The octopus was attempted on the iPad with an apple pencil. The below poster was inspired by some 1970's posters of New York using Adobe on a windows machine.
