I modded a toy kitchen

![A Toy Kitchen](/assets/images/posts/toy-kitchen.png)

For my 1 and a half year holds christmas my wife wanted to buy her an ikea toy kitchen, but she wasn't happy with how it bare wood look for our living room, we've already got a mixture of woods going on and adding a new one would have just pushed it over the top.

We settled on a white and copper / gold theme. Simply painting all the panels before assembling using spray paints ensures a clean look without any streaks and masking tape to avoid spillage. I was able to match the white of the original white panels very closely, so that I didn’t have to repaint them, this saved a lot of time and worry about spray paint getting on to the acrylic.

The hardest part was masking the hob element for the gold trim, I wasn’t able to find a way to separate the plastic and paint it on its own.

The wood parts took 3 coats of white to create an even consistent finish and match the existing panels. The plastic coated in gold took 2 coats plus a 3rd coat of a protective spray.
