I made a Jekyll website, this website. To keep track of the creative and personal projects I've worked on over the years.

I'm hoping by putting this online I'll spur myself on to create more, to look back and see how much I've impoved.

But... most importantly to remind myself that when you sit down and deadicate time, push yourself out of your comfort zone just a little you can surprise yourself with the results.
