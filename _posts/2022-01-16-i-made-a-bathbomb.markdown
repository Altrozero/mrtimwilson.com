I made a bathbomb with the kids

Christmas has just passed and I'm pretty impressed by just how much of my money Lush managed to make me part with. The wife, my sisters, and now even the kids got bath bombs for Christmas, it was top of the 5 year olds christmas list. And they ain’t CHEAP, but I am!

The goal of this was to save a buck and spend the afternoon with the kids.

## How I Made…

After doing a bunch of research online I found creating your own bath bombs is actually a pretty common thing, and can be created a bunch of different ways.

**Disclaimer** I did my own research and tested the items below on my own skin before letting others try, that doesn’t mean they’ll be suitable for your skin.

We settled on the following recipe;
- 250g bicarbonate of soda (for the fizz)
- 100g citric acid (for the fizz)
- 50g Epsom Salts (for the fizz)
- 50g corn flour (to hold it together)
- 50ml of Coconut oil (to hold it together)
- A drop of food colouring (to colour it)
- Crushed lavender (for the top and to spread out on the surface of the water)
- 10ml of lavender oil (for the scent)

All items were bought from Amazon or Tesco.

We mixed everything apart from the crushed lavender in a bowl to the consistency of a moldable sand. You should be able to pick it up and crush it together with your hand, and it should stay together, until poked apart. **Warning** literally a drop of food colouring, or you’ll be emerging from the bath blue.

We then sprinkled some crushed lavender at the bottom of a reusable cupcake case (silicon, purchasable on Amazon). And firmly pressed the mixture into the case, making sure it went into all the creases. Quite a bit of pressure was applied to give it the best chance of staying together.

We then left them overnight to dry before turning them out the next day.
