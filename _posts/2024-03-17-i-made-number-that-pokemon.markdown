I made a number that pokemon game.

My oldest child has been getting in to pokemon cards over the past couple of years, it's been fun sitting with him and leafing through binders of cards while he explains all the pokemon from my childhood to me.

With the release of Pokemon 151 Scarlet and Violet trading set I decided to start collecting again with him. Trading cards, buying singles and completing my own binder. As a kid I used to know all 151 in order (more or less), despite having a terrible memory. Playing with the kid it's been fun flexing that knowledge, but I'm incredibly stale.

I made "Number That Pokemon" as a fun little side project with him to practice and introduce him a bit to design.

Play the game here: [https://altrozero.github.io/number-that-pokemon/](https://altrozero.github.io/number-that-pokemon/)

I really wanted to play around with showing the cards off in a cool way. I added the ability for the cards to tilt on mouse over and an animated holo effect on ex cards.

Annoyingly all the cards have their number in the set on the card, for 151 this is also the order of the pokemon... so an overlay to blur that out was added. ON TOP OF THAT all the cards apart from the EX cards have their pokedex number under their primary image, so that had to be blurred as well.

All in all a really fun project, the code is hosted on github at [https://github.com/Altrozero/number-that-pokemon](https://github.com/Altrozero/number-that-pokemon)
