I built a mini keyboard

![A Mini Keyboard](/assets/images/posts/mini-keyboard.png)

Wanting to improve my soldering skills, plus a birthday project to keep my hands and brains busy I bought this kit from [MechBoards.co.uk](https://mechboards.co.uk)

The instructions that came with the kit were surprisingly sparse, with a few steps missing and the mounting kit that arrived different to the documentation. However everything was fairly easy to work out and despite the kit shipping with a wrong screw MechBoards support managed to sort the issue within a day.
