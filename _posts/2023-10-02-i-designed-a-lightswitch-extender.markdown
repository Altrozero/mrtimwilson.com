I designed a lightswitch extender.

My 4 year old has been having a problem reaching the lightswitch for the bathroom and waking us in the night to put it on for her. Unfortunatly we couldn't simply put a stool right in front of the switch as it's in between 2 active doorways, so we needed a lightswitch extender.

After looking online there didn't really seem to be too many options, certainly not within the UK. A clever one we saw used a wheel on a stick held in place by a frame, however it didn't fit our specific lightswitch.

So I designed and printed one. 

Check out the design on printables: [https://www.printables.com/model/784923-light-switch-extender-for-children](https://www.printables.com/model/784923-light-switch-extender-for-children)

Update 28th of Feb 2023: The handle on this broke, it took almost 5 months. It was printed with a 30% infill and in hindsight it should have been printed with 100%. Fortunatly they are now old enough to reach.
