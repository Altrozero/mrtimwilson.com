I baked and decorated a pig mud cake

![A Pig Mud Cake](/assets/images/posts/mud-cake.png)

This was a project with the wife for our 2 year olds birthday. Her specifications were "Pink" and "Pig". Say no more...

A moist chocolate cake, with a ganache topping, wrapped in kit kat’s to give it a pig pen feel. Then a few pig models arranged appropriately.

Overall this was actually way more stressful than we thought, we figured this would be fairly easy, however getting the kit kats to stay in place was a nightmare, in the end we resorted to ribbon to ensure they stuck.

## How I Made…
2 cakes stacked on top of each other, with a lot of kit kats wrapped around the outside.

We really struggled to get the Kit Kats to stick, we tried melting the bottoms, using a chocolate spread and fondant, but we just couldn’t get them to adhere. When they did stick they’d fall off a few minutes later pulling a chunk of cake with it. In the end we resorted to using chocolate spread as a binder and a ribbon to ensure they held in place.

The MUD was simply melted chocolate with a bit of butter mixed in to ensure it didn’t set, bringing it just past the point of melting and mixing in the butter as fast as possible gives it this lovely glossy look. It tastes delicious with the cake and looks great under lights. It never really sets so has to be contained or put in the fridge quickly.

The Pigs were pink fondant, quickly rolled into balls and prodded with tools to give indends. We spread a bit of the mud around one of the pigs, but in hindsight this was a mistake so we took it off as best we could, this left just a bit of residue on the back pig, that works pretty well.
