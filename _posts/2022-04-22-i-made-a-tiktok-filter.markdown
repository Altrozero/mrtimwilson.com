I made a proof of concept Tik Tok filter.

## How I Made...
Tik Tok recently released [Effect House](https://effecthouse.tiktok.com/), this was made using the first version of the application on a mac.

As this was only a simple proof of concept created as a pitch before giving it to a team of actual skilled artists, I took a very simple approach; get a couple of 3D models imported and get them to track your head as you move about.

As such the entire process took around an hour, mainly because the assets used weren’t created in the correct orientation and scale. The hat model lacked faces on the inside and as such as you tilt your head back you can see through the inside of the hat.

The software at this stage is not really ready for a full time creative, but it’s darn close. Currently the software regularly locks up or outright crashes, sometimes the filters just stop working.

**Update:** The artists took on this project and were able to get the mouth, eyes, eyebrows and even the tongue to track your face. The software is truly fantastic.
