I made a coloring book.

![Coloring Book Front](/assets/images/posts/coloring-1.png)

For Christmas I made my Wife and Daughter a coloring book, each drawing in the book
was based around her, either a toy or activity that she enjoyed.

With 30 pages for coloring and a glossy front and back the outcome was beyond my
expectations.

It took a little over a month with Adobe Illustrator to design and then longer than
I'd like to admit working in Adobe Acrobat to prepear it for the printers. I used
a company called [Mixam Printing](https://mixam.co.uk/colouringbook). They came out
looking great.
