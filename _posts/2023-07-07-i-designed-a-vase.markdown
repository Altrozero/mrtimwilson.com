I designed a vase.

![A Vase](/assets/images/posts/vase.webp)

I've been playing with Fusion 360 and the Bamboo labs P1 printer. I was looking
for ideas of things to print for my sisters who were visited and came across a
few different vases. I figured it might be a fun little project.

I'm fairly happy with how it turned out, but I wish I had spent some more time
polishing the top.

Either way it printing it red made it pop nicely.
