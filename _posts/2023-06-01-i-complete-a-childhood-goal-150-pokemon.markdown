I caught all 150 pokemon in pokemon blue.

An odd and seemingly meaningless goal, but one of several that I always dreamed of completing as a kid.
It wasn't particular challenging, more time consuming but something that was always out of reach as a child.

I've had a gameboy colour sitting in a box for years, but they aren't fun devices to use. The lack of a nice backlight has made it a depressing experience.

So for a couple of years I've been looking at the long waiting lists of the [Analouge Pocket](https://store.analogue.co/#pocket) but it's always been out of reach. Either out of stock, not shipping to the UK or with waiting lists of 6 months or more. But now a days they are shipping devices like the Anbernic RG35XX on amazon for as low as Â£50-60. It's been a great device for playing some of my old favourties.

Catching all 150 without a link cable for trading was the main concern, however I discoverd this really cool ROM mod on github called [redstarbluestar](https://github.com/Rangi42/redstarbluestar) that allows for catching them all on a single cartridge.

1 childhood goal down.
